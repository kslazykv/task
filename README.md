# CHOOOSE

#### The following repository contains my solution to the task given by CHOOOSE. The purpose of this task was to create a responsive layout with card elements. Depending on the json file, corresponding number of cards should be fetched together with all the neccessary information (title, CO2 emission, number of stars, etc.).

## Instructions

In order to run my project:
1. Clone the repository using:
### `git clone https://github.com/kslazykv/task-chooose.git`

<br>

2. Install all required libraries and dependencies:
### `npm i`

<br>

3. Start the project using:
### `npm start`

<br>

## Demo

Now you should be able to see the following layout:

<img width=100% align="center" src="public\demo\cards3.jpg" title="cards3"/>

If you go to "src/data/data.json", you can modify it in the way that...

... 2 cards are displayed:
<img width=100% align="center" src="public\demo\cards2.jpg" title="cards3"/>

or 5 cards are displayed:
<img width=100% align="center" src="public\demo\cards5.jpg" title="cards3"/>

or to any other configuration.
